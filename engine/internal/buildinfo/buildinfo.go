// Package buildinfo carries the engine version.
//
// The default is a sensible fallback for local/dev builds; release builds
// override it at link time (all three CI workflows do this):
//
//      go build -ldflags "-X github.com/ScoobyBaby1999/doomalay/engine/internal/buildinfo.Version=v0.30.1" ./cmd/doomalay
//
// /api/health and /api/capabilities report this value, so the API always
// answers with the real release tag instead of a constant that silently
// drifts (the v0.28.0 red-team found "0.1.0" on a v0.28.0 build).

// Dev reports whether this is a DEV build (v0.48 task 5): local builds
// (default Version carries "-dev") or an explicit DOOMALAY_DEV=1. Release
// builds stamp a clean tag via -ldflags, so the flag is off in production.
// Dev builds unlock developer-only surface (e.g. the cloud-providers
// "use public key" pill).
